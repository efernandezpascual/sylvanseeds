# SylvanSeeds, a seed germination database for temperate deciduous forests

This repository stores all the information related to the publication
*SylvanSeeds, a seed germination database for temperate deciduous
forests*, including the raw datasets, the scripts to perform data
cleaning and analysis, and the `Rmarkdown` files to create the
manuscript.

*SylvanSeeds* is a dataset of seed germination ecology for the temperate
broadleaf and mixed forest biome of the northern hemisphere. It contains
data on \>300 plant species, obtained from \>500 published references.
The data is in the form of germination proportions recorded under
experimental combinations of temperature, light, scarification and
stratification.

## Contents

al.Â 2017](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) for recording
and storing research projects.

The following materials are available in this repository:

  - `data` Original raw files including the primary result of the search
    in the Web of Science, and search notes.
  - `doc` Files to create the manuscript using `Rmarkdown`.
  - `results` Output of the `R` scripts, including the clean database
    and files needed to create the manuscript.
  - `src` Scripts in `R` language used to clean the raw data, perform
    the analyses of the manuscript, and build the `SylvanSeeds` app.
